Mario Project:

Project Description:
In this project we recreated the first level (World 1-1) from the original Super Mario Bros. game, but a more simplified version of it. In
the project we implemented the level generation by reading from a text file and generating blocks, goombas, and the player based on 
certain characters. Additionally, we implemented the player's controls and movement, the goomba movement, and the animations and sound
effects of the game.

Coding features and principles focused on in the project:
 - Leading edge/trailing edge input recognition for player controls such as jumping in the context of Mario
 - Utilizing Semi-Implicit Euler Integration to handle calculation involving the effect of gravity on the player
 - Handling Axis-Aligned Bounding Box collisions in the context of platform games
 - Implementing scrolling backgrounds and calculating appropriate camera position in the context of the player position and world position
 - Generating sprite animations be flipping through a series of sprites based on a set frame rate and the number of animation frames
 - Reading from a text file and dynamically generating a level based on the location of specific characters in the file
 - Playing sound effects and background music along with controlling sound channels
 

Code Snippets:
I cannot publicly post my code for this project due to the fact that this is still an active class. For the purposes of internship
applications, please send an email to pmoghadd@usc.edu requesting for code files/samples and they will be provided.
