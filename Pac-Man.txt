Pac-Man Project:

Project Description:
In this project we wrote the AI of the ghost characters for a (mostly) faithful recreation of the original Pac-Man. We implemented a path
finding algorithm to generate paths to specific targets on the game board for the ghosts. Additionally, we wrote the logic and movement
for the four different states of movement: scatter, chase, frightened, and dead and the logic that handles transitioning between the
different states. For the chase state, we implemented the ghost specific chasing logic for the four different ghost: Blinky, Inky, Pinky
and Clyde.


Coding features and principles focused on in the project:
 - Implementing a state-machine style AI system to control which set of movement logic to assign for the ghosts at the given time
 - Using A* Euclidean heuristic algorithm to perform path finding functions to generate the shortest path to a target movement node
 

Code Snippets:
I cannot publicly post my code for this project due to the fact that this is still an active class. For the purposes of internship
applications, please send an email to pmoghadd@usc.edu requesting for code files/samples and they will be provided.
