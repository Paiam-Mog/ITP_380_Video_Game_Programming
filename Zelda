Zelda Project:

Project Description:
In this project we implemented a dungeon inspired by "The Eagle" dungeon from the original The Legend of Zelda game for the NES, but our 
implementation features less rooms, enemy types, and interactable objects than the original dungeon, but we still capture the look and 
feel of the game. In this project, we generated the level by using tile mapping techniques by reading a CSV file and drawing specific
tiles based on the corresponding tile ID number. Additionally we implemented the player controls, attack and movement, interactable
objects in the environment such as secret blocks that open doors, collectable objects, enemy movement and attack patterns (including a
boss battle), along with sprite animations and sound effects.

Coding features and principles focused on in the project:
 - Utilizing tile mapping techniques to generate dungeon rooms by reading from a CVS file and creating tiles corresponding to specific
   values in the file
 - Implementing collectables by using call back functions that take in the specific functions based on type of object collected
 - Leading edge/trailing edge input recognition for player controls such as attacking in the context of Link
 - Generating sprite animations be flipping through a series of sprites based on a set frame rate and the number of animation frames
 - Playing sound effects and background music along with controlling sound channels
 
 
Code Snippets:
I cannot publicly post my code for this project due to the fact that this is still an active class. For the purposes of internship
applications, please send an email to pmoghadd@usc.edu requesting for code files/samples and they will be provided.
