# Code Snippets
This repository contains descriptions of various projects done as class work and the coding concepts and principles involved in their implimentations. Due to the fact that this is still an active class, code snippets and samples will not be directly posted. For the sake of interviews and internship/job applications, code work and project files will be provide if requested through my email pmoghadd@usc.edu.
