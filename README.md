# ITP_380_Video_Game_Programming

# Course Description
Programming course at the University of Southern California under the Viterbi School of Engineering in the Information Technology Program. The course focuses on the underlying concepts and principles involved in programming for video games including vectors, transformations, 3D math, geometric primitives and matrices. The course requires past knowledge and understanding of C++ programming language and all programs are written in C++.

# Code Snippets
This repository contains descriptions of various projects done as class work and the coding concepts and principles involved in their implimentations. Due to the fact that this is still an active class, code snippets and samples will not be directly posted. For the sake of interviews and internship/job applications, code work and project files will be provide if requested through my email pmoghadd@usc.edu. 

# Game Files
This repository contains zipped folders containing builds of the game projects. To play the game, download the zipped folder and run the executable file inside the folder. Do not move the executable file or any other files from the folder in order to run the game properly. Some of the projects do not have game instructions displayed in the game, so they are provided in a text document labeled 'Instructions' in the folder. If there are any issues with the files or you are having trouble running the game, please email me at pmoghadd@usc.edu and describe the issue you are facing.
