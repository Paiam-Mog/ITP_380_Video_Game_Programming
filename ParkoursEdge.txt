Parkour's Edge Project:

Project Description:
For the final project of the class we created a parkour game inspired by Mirror's Edge called Parkour's Edge. In this project, we 
implemented a variety of different features such as physics based movement, player movement state system, line segment intersection for 
laser reflection and detection, quarternion based roation, collectibles, UI elements such as radar, messages and timers, location based 
sound projection, and more.


Coding features and principles focused on in the project:
 - Implemented a complex player state movement machine that utilized collision detection to determine if a player was wall climbing, 
   jumping, wall running, falling, or on the ground
 - Utilized forces and phsyics to simulate movement, gravity, and friction
 - Using line segment intersection on laser mines to determine collisions with objects such as mirrors, which reflected the laser onto 
   other surfaces, as well as the player to determine if the mine "detonated"
 - Implemented player and object rotation by using quaternions
 - Applied object parenting to have objects act as children to other objects and have their respective world positions be update base on 
   the parent space
 - Checkpoint system that displayed messages to the player such as tutorials for the controls and movement and determine player 
   progression and level advancement
 - Displayed UI elements such as timers, collectible counter, tutorial messages to the player (in the case of checkpoints), and a radar
   system that displayed blips of enemy camera and their direction relative to the player
 - Implemented enemy security cameras that used cone detection to scan for players and played location based audio that would fall off as 
   the player moves away and increase in volume as the player approached
 

Code Snippets:
I cannot publicly post my code for this project due to the fact that this is still an active class. For the purposes of internship
applications, please send an email to pmoghadd@usc.edu requesting for code files/samples and they will be provided.
