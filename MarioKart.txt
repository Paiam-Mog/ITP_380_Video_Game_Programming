Mario Kart Project:

Project Description:
In this project we recreated the Rainbow Road race from the original Super Mario Kart game, but a more simplified version of it. In
the project we implemented the use of heightmaps by reading from a CSV file, full character vehicle controller, enemy racer AI that 
utilized the same controls scheme as the player. Additionally, we implemented game UI, sound effects and music, and a spring camera to 
help visualize player movement.


Coding features and principles focused on in the project:
 - Implementating heightmaps of the track to have the player change altitude as they race and move about in the game space
 - Conversion of grid cell positions on the heightmap to world coordinates in the game space to detect player position on the track
 - Vehicle Controller script that create a set of controls and inputs that both the player and the enemy AI utilize to control vehicles
 - Wrote an enemy AI script that determines whether or not to accelerate forward or turn right/left based on relative position to specific
   pathing points in a given list
 - Used checkpoints that convert the player's world positions to cell positions of the grid space to determine if they have advanced    
   past or fallen behind the enemy racer
 - Created and attached a spring camera to the player to help visualize the kart turning on the track as well as asceding or descending
   down ramps in the game
 - Implemented UI that displays to the player the current lap they are on and what position they are in the race as well as indicating to
   the player when they have advanced to the next lap and if they won or lost
 - Playing sound effects and background music along with controlling sound channels 


Code Snippets:
I cannot publicly post my code for this project due to the fact that this is still an active class. For the purposes of internship
applications, please send an email to pmoghadd@usc.edu requesting for code files/samples and they will be provided.
